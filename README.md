## Disclaimer

This tool is for educational purposes only. Use it at your own risk and make sure to comply with Hypixel's rules and regulations regarding third-party tools. This tool complies with the Hypixel rules and Skyblock rules, as it does not actually buy the flip, only finding it and notifying you when a flip has been found, making you do the actual purchasing.

We are not responsible for any coins lost or accounts banned/wiped. Our algorithm isn't perfect. We try to make it as good as possible, but some people may try to inflate item prices beyond our predictions. Keep in mind that an item's price can and will naturally change as well.

This version of the tool is (current) only for beta testers and developers, and will always remain free.
